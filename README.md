<h1 align="center">Accessibility Reference Website</h1>
<p>An example website, build for testing accessibility issues.</p>

<h2>Who is behind this project?</h2>

<p>This project is developed in co-operation between <a href="https://www.nr.no/">Norsk Regnesentral</a> and 
<a href="https://www.webstep.com">Webstep</a>, through funding by <a href="https://www.bufdir.no/uu/UnIKT/">UnIKT (norwegian)</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to develop a website with one accessible version, and one inaccessible version. 
It is supposed to be a more modern version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/">"Before and After Demonstration"</a> by <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. 
In practice, we mean to implement that the user can toggle individual accessibility issues, to test each issue specifically.</p>

<p>In addition to looking more modern, it should use modern frontend tools and typical patterns found in real-life, 
so that it better represents actual sites users can encounter on the web today.</p>

<p>The components developed should also be able to use as examples of best practice implementations. 
If time permits, we will present them in a separate styleguide and publish them as a component library.</p>

<p>The actual site will mimic a web shop, though, of course, no purchase will be possible. 
User data submitted through checkout will only be saved on the user's computer.</p>

<h2>Where can I find the site?</h2>
<p>The site has not yet been published. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Translations</h2>
<p>The site will initially be developed with translations for English and Norwegian. 
We hope for community translations to other languages, to make the site accessible to more users.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>After the initial project is finished, we will be open for contributions to both code and translations.</p>

<p>Please submit <a href="https://github.com/it-vegard/a11y-reference-website/issues">issues</a> or 
<a href="https://github.com/it-vegard/a11y-reference-website/pulls">pull-request</a> if you find opportunities for improvements.</p>

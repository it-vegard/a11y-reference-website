            You can either set the rules one by one, or globally with the switch
            on top.

            Load this website with <samp>?enableRules=false</samp> in the URI to
            disable all rules.
            <samp>?enableRules=true</samp> in the URI enables all rules. You can
            also use the shortcut path <samp>v1</samp> to switch on all rules
            and <samp>v2</samp> to switch off all rules.

            developer tools as failures are injected into the page or taken
            away. Some errors may become visible in the graphical user

            Study what impact the injection of A11Y failures has with regard to
            what content can or cannot be accessed, and potentially how the user
            experience changes. The aforementioned can also be carried out in
            combination with impairment simulation tools, or real users.

            Then pass the static page URI as computed to the accessiblity
            checker of your choice to study whether the A11Y failures are
            properly detected. Count false positives and negatives.

            Pick an audit metric such as SUS. Then calculate the metric for the
            solution you need to assess, as well as for this website, by letting
            users test both as part of task assignments. Determine the chosen
            metric(s) for each user. Compare both metrics with each other for
            various user groups.
